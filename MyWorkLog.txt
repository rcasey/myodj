My Work Log on Outdoor Journal project

    - replaced the join table btw Trips & Partners with has_many...through construct. Good Railscast #47 explains
    that it is more flexible. Also Railscast #196 & 197 on Nested Model Forms are helping...but aren't exactly
    what I want, since I'd like to have a picklist of Partners from which I can add to a Trip.

    - see Railscast #234, SimpleForm. This gem looks like it will handle the association I need
    to include Partners on the Trips edit form.
